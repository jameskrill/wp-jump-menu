<h3>THIS PLUGIN IS A MUST HAVE FOR WORDPRESS DEVELOPERS!</h3>

<em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Now featuring <a href="http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/" target="_blank">Chosen</a> JavaScript library for select menu styling and functionality. </em>

Sick of having to go to your Posts list or Pages list to edit an entry?  Me too.

The WP Jump Menu plugin is a useful plugin that adds a drop-down "jump" menu to the bottom or top of the WordPress admin area which allows you to select from a list of pages, posts or custom post types and jump right into editing that page.

<h3>Why is this needed?</h3>

By adding this ability, you can save TONS OF TIME when editing a bunch of posts or pages.  No more do you have to click on Pages, and then search for the right page in the list, and then click on the title or on edit.   Simply find the page or post in the drop-down (which is neatly organized and indented) and it will jump to edit that page or post.

<h3>Customizable</h3>

The plugin comes with an options page where you can edit the position of the jump bar (top or bottom of the screen, or in the WordPress admin bar), whether or not to use Chosen (which features searching through the drop down!), the background color, font color, link color, border color and the icon and message that optionally get displayed on the left hand side (only when not in the WordPress admin bar), status colors, and many more options.

<h2>Great for theme developers to help clients navigate in the admin area of WordPress.</h2>
We use this plugin on all of our projects and decided it was time to release it to the world!

Enjoy!

<em>Please provide feedback for this plugin to help improve it!  Having issues?!? Post in the support forum and I will fix it right away!</em>

== Installation ==


1. Upload the `wp-jump-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You'll find the options under Settings->WP Jump Menu
4. In the settings, you can customize the jump menu's location, colors, sort order, and enter in custom post types (comma seperated) to list in the jump menu.
5. Make sure you click save to save your settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any way to add additional content to the jump menu? =

Yes.

There are two filters that run at the beginning of the menu and at the end.

The first is:

`wpjm-filter-beginning-of-list`

which happens after the first <option> which is "Select to Edit"

and the second is:

`wpjm-filter-end-of-list`

which happens just before the last <optgroup> which is for the Jump Menu Settings page.

Your filter function would look something like this:

    function wpjm_filter( $wpjm_string ) {

        $wpjm_string .= '<optgroup label="Global Content Blocks">';
        $wpjm_string .= '<option value="url-on-select">Option Name</option>';
        $wpjm_string .= '</optgroup>';

        return $wpjm_string;

    }

And your apply_filters would look like this:

`apply_filters( 'wpjm-beginning-of-list', 'wpjm-filter' )`

= The jump menu isn't working. =

If the jump menu isn't working, please submit a forum post and I will respond asap. <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-jump-menu?forum_id=10#postform">Click here to start a forum thread</a>.

Make sure you have the latest version of WordPress and the latest version of WP-Jump-Menu.

= How do I put my logo in? =

The branding options are only accessible when the position of the jump menu is set to top or bottom, and not WP Admin Bar. You need to upload your logo icon, through WordPress maybe, and get the full URL to the image.  This you will put into the Logo Icon field in the options.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Jump Menu in the WordPress Admin Bar

2. The Options Page - Here you can edit the drop-down list of custom post types (as well as built in post types) and their order, change the colors of the WP Jump Menu, and specify a few other options!

3. The Jump Menu - Just a drop down, but one POWERFUL drop down!

* Completed/fixed the sorting of the post types on the options page. Now you can sort the post types in the order you want them to appear in the Jump Menu, and when you save that order, the table-list will stay in the order you saved it in.
* Started using wp_cache to store the list of posts, pages, etc. that Jump Menu displays in it's drop-down, so it is not querying the database on every page load.  Hopefully I did this right and it works, if anyone wants to jump in the code and check for me... great!

= 2.1.4 =
* Fixed error (variable not array)

= 2.1.3 =

= 2.1 =
* Fixed bug: Can be displayed at the top of the screen WITH the WP Admin Bar, whereas before it was being hidden when both were activated and on the top.
* Totally redid the Post Types and the way you select them.  You can now select (or deselect) any post type.  Not just custom post types.  So you can totally turn off pages, or posts - or now you can add attachments!
* Redid the options page using wp_settings.  Much better!
* Added the title "WP Jump Menu" next to the drop-down

= 2.0 =
* Totally redid the form layout to match native WP admin styles

= 1.4 =
* Cleaned up a little bit, and updated the readme.txt
